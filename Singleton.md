# Lazy Initialization Approach: 

        Do follow the following steps.
        Create a class with Private constructor --- this allows the applications not to create its instance.
        add a private static variable of the class. --- static because the element gets created at class level rather than object level.
        Now add public method with singleton class return type. 



# Eager Initialization:


# Thread safe (Inefficeient way):


# Thread safe (Efficient):



# Approach which prevents Singleton form Reflextion/Serialization/Cloning
